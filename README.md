# NineAnalytics

NineAnalytics will serve as a replacement for the Segway-Ninebot app, without the features that I deem useless, and with a few usefull ones added on top.

As of now, nothing works.

This source code can be compiled with Android Studio and Gradle.
Based on Android-nRF-UART app by Nordic Semiconductor.

### Note
- Android 4.3 or later is required.
- Android Studio supported
